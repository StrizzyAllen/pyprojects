# pyprojects
Big and Small python projects from Al Sweigart  

### These are the first 10 projects from Al Sweigart's "The Big Book of Small Python Projects". 
# Projects:  
* Bagels
* Birthday Paradox
* Bitmap Message
* Blackjack
* Bouncing DVD Logo
* Ceaser Cipher
* Ceaser Hacker
* Calendar Maker
* Carrot in a Box
* Cho-Han Dice Game  

### I will be using his projects as a baseline so you might see some differences from mine and his. The goal is to learn python basics from these projects and get creative with them. 
### Feel free to take and modify these games to create your own version.
